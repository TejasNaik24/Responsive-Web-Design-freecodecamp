        Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, and cryptanalyst. His groundbreaking work laid the foundation for computer science and artificial intelligence. During World War II, Turing played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code, which significantly helped the Allies win the war. Turing also introduced the concept of the Turing Machine, a theoretical framework for modern computers.

        Tragically, his life was cut short due to persecution for his homosexuality, but his legacy lives on as one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century.

# Responsive Web Design – FreeCodeCamp Certification Projects

This repository contains my completed projects for the **Responsive Web Design certification** offered by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). As part of this certification, I completed five hands-on web development challenges focused on building responsive, accessible, and standards-compliant websites using **HTML** and **CSS**.

Each project demonstrates core concepts in modern frontend development such as layout design, semantic HTML5 structure, responsive styling with CSS Flexbox and Grid, and user interface accessibility.
